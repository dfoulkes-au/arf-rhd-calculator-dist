  <h2>Calculator for Acute Rheumatic Fever (Experimental) - Deployment Package</h2>
</div>


## Overview

This project is a deployment package including html/js/css etc for a browser-based single page application providing a user friendly implementation of the 2020 Australian criteria for Acute Rheumatic Fever diagnosis - based on Revised Jones Criteria for the Australian context.

**NOTE: This is experimental software and is not approved for diagnostic purposes.**

[Here](https://arf-calculator.nardhc.org/) is an example of the ARF Calculator.

To deploy this package simply clone the repo and copy the contents to a web server folder.

The code for this project describes a single page application that can be built using NodeJS, the Vue 3 framework, and Vuetify UI Library.   If you wish to access the code to modify or contribute to the project,  you can find it [here](https://github.com/dfoulkes-au/arf-rhd-calculator).

## Background

Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) results from the bodyâ€™s autoimmune response following an infection with Group A Streptococcus bacterium (Streptococcus pyogenes). Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) refers to the long-term cardiac damage caused by either a single severe episode or multiple recurrent episodes of ARF.  The development of ARF occurs approximately two weeks after S. pyogenes infection . The clinical manifestations and symptoms of ARF can be severe and are described in the Revised Jones Criteria.

## Deployment

In order to deploy the ARF Calculator,  first Clone this repository by executing:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dfoulkes-au/arf-rhd-calculator-dist.git
```

To deploy the package on the internet, you will need to have access to a web server and have permissions to copy files to the a folder that is served by the web server.
In this case,  simply copy all files and folders from the folder you have cloned to a specified folder on your web server.  You should then be able to access the IG in your browser.

If you want to test the ARF Calculator on a local computer,  then install Python.   Then change to the folder on your computer that contains the cloned content.
Run the following command:

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then in your browser go to http://localhost:8000/index.html
